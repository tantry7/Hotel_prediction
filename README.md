1. Out of all th projects that i have worked on, a few challenging ones were, firstly representional analysis and prediction of Indian census data.
This was a ML/DS project, in which past  literacy rate death rate etc of our country were used to predict future literacy rate death rate etc of our country
The challenges faced were 1.low data, and which regression algorithms predicts the best outcome.
The first problem was solved by using data augmentation and regularisation.
2nd problem was solved by mainly using multiple regression algorithms and  using performance metrics such as mean squared error and root means squared error to choosing the best algorithm which had the least error

2. Backpropogation is the method of tuning ones network by mainly Readjusting its wieghts. the specific problem has to be solved probabaly by either taking stocastic gradient descent or using dropout higher that 40%.
